# nova-host
a clearnet app for urbiters that allows users to sign in with their onchain Urbit ID, to message on-usb in obfuscated group messaging playing on the idea of collective intelligence finding consensus. 

## core concepts

### 1. Embedded wallet sign in
use of sequence embedded wallet sign in with playfab to pass securely an onchain Urbit ID as a user account to generate a session ticket

### 2. Pooled messsaging obfuscation
- buy an nft to have entrance to a chat
- message authors get grouped by random group of chat participation, so an onchain author can have 1-6 authors, and this index is stored on user device
- gas obscurity -> less gas on network, more obfuscated onchain
- user considered "is online" to be included in sessions -> work in progress numbers: 70% recency of time on chain (less max of 30 days) vs. 30% of total supply minted in chat to be included in others

### 3. Downloadable images
- messages can be downloaded and stored in file system, as takeaways after group has been dissolved
